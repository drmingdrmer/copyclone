error[E0599]: the method `duplicate_impl` exists for reference `&&Wrapper<&NotClone>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied
 --> tests/fail/not_clone.rs:1:10

1 | #[derive(dupit::Duplicate)]
  |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `&&Wrapper<&NotClone>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
2 | struct NotClone;
  | --------------- doesn't satisfy `NotClone: Clone` or `NotClone: Copy`
  |
 ::: src/lib.rs
  |
  |     pub struct Wrapper<T>(pub T);
  |     --------------------- doesn't satisfy `Wrapper<&NotClone>: DuplicateImpl<NotClone>`
  |
  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `NotClone: Copy`
          which is required by `&Wrapper<&NotClone>: DuplicateImpl<NotClone>`
          `NotClone: Clone`
          which is required by `Wrapper<&NotClone>: DuplicateImpl<NotClone>`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `dupit::Duplicate` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `NotClone` with `#[derive(Clone, Copy)]`
